# Smart-irrigation-by-Iot
Smart Irrigation using Internet of Things (IoT) technology have emerged as a promising solution
to optimize water usage in agriculture. The system integrates sensors to gather data on soil
moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant requirements. Through a centralized IoT platform,
this data is processed in real- time to make informed decisions about irrigation scheduling. The
goal is to create an intelligent and automated irrigation system that not only conserves water at
the right time. The proposed solution aims to contribute to sustainable agricultural practices by 
leveraging Iot for efficient water management in arrigation.
